The World Bank systematically assesses the appropriateness of official exchange rates as conversion factors. In this country, multiple or dual exchange rate activity exists and must be accounted for appropriately in underlying statistics. An alternative estimate (“alternative conversion factor” - PA.NUS.ATLS) is thus calculated as a weighted average of the different exchange rates in use in the country. Doing so better reflects economic reality and leads to more accurate cross-country comparisons and country classifications by income level. For this country, this applies to the period 1978-1993. Alternative conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodology and elsewhere in World Development Indicators as single-year conversion factors.",2020,,Country uses the 2008 System of National Accounts methodology,Value added at producer prices (VAP),"2021, 2017, 2011",BPM6,Preliminary,General trade system,Consolidated central government,Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS),"Integrated household survey (IHS), 2015",,2016,2007,2018,CN,CN,China,China
